# FunctionGrapher
FunctionGrapher is a very versatile program that I am creating as an instructional mathematics tool. The code is currently in alpha, so there is nothing much to see here!

### Current Features
This is a semi-current list of the current features that are in the program. I can't guarantee that I will update this often, but it _will_ be updated whenever a new release is released. You will also be able to view this information in the program.

+ 2D and 3D graphing
+ Mouse control of 3D graphs
+ Image creation
+ Multi-graph support
+ Cinematic mode (fancy rotating graphs)

### Planned Features
This is another semi-current list that contains features that I __will__ be adding to the program. I don't know when I will get to all of them, but most of them will be added to the next release.

+ Entering custom equations
+ Changing the X and Y limits (window)
+ Exporting and importing graph files (loading and saving equations)
+ Changing graph colors and axis/grid colors

### Possible Features
This is a list of possible features that I will be adding to the program. This is the only list that is not guaranteed to be in the program. The only reasons that you will not see these in a release is because of lack of time, lack of ability, or I end up scrapping the idea.

+ Antialiasing
+ Multiple graphing planes per window
